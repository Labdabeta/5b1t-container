# Base 5b1t Image

This image can only compile the 5b1t compiler. It cannot compile 5b1t on its own.

In order to use 5b1t you will need to build 5b1t in at least the 5b1t-build image.

In order to test 5b1t you will need to build 5b1t in at least the 5b1t-test image.

In order to compile 5b1t documentation you will need to build 5b1t in at least the 5b1t-docs image.

If you want to just run 5b1t code you probably want the 5b1t image, which already contains a built version of the compiler.
