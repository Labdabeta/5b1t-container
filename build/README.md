# 5b1t Build Image

This image can build a working 5b1t compiler. It cannot run tests on it.

In order to test 5b1t you will need to build 5b1t in at least the 5b1t-test image.

In order to compile 5b1t documentation you will need to build 5b1t in at least the 5b1t-docs image.

If you want to just run 5b1t code you probably want the 5b1t image, which already contains a built version of the compiler.
